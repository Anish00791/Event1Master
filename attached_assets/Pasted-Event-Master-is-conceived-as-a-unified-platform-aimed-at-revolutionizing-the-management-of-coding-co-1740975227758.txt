Event Master is conceived as a unified platform aimed at revolutionizing the management of coding contests and hackathons. It solves the challenge of juggling multiple disconnected tools by offering a centralized system that streamlines every step of contest management—from event creation and registration to live tracking and post-event analytics. This not only simplifies the process for organizers but also enhances the overall experience for participants and sponsors. 



Centralized Event Creation & Management

A user-friendly interface that lets organizers create, customize, and schedule events.
Tools to set contest timelines and manage registrations all within one dashboard.
Automated Registration & Team Formation

Seamless registration flow for participants.
An algorithm-driven process that recommends team formations based on participants’ skills and preferences, ensuring balanced teams and efficient team assembly.
Real-Time Live Tracking & Leaderboard

Implementation of live score updates using technologies like WebSockets.
Interactive leaderboards that update instantly to reflect ongoing contest performance.
Integrated Communication System

Automated notifications through multiple channels (email, SMS, in-app alerts, and push notifications) to keep participants, organizers, and sponsors informed throughout the contest lifecycle.
Certificate Distribution

An automated system for generating and distributing certificates at the contest’s conclusion, allowing participants to download their certificates with a single click.
Technical Architecture & Implementation

Backend:
Utilize Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js to build scalable RESTful APIs. The microservices architecture will decouple various components, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
Frontend:
Develop the dynamic user interface using React or Angular to create a responsive and engaging experience.
Database & Caching:
Employ PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data storage alongside Redis for caching to handle real-time data and ensure speedy performance.
Security:
Implement robust security measures with OAuth 2.0 and JWT for secure data transmission and authentication.
User Experience & Design

Onboarding:
Incorporate a simple, guided registration process with clear instructions and tooltips to help users get started quickly.
Dashboard:
Create an intuitive dashboard for both organizers and participants that displays real-time contest progress, announcements, and a live leaderboard.
Responsive Design:
Ensure the site is fully responsive and accessible across all devices, with high contrast for readability and compatibility with assistive technologies.
Success Metrics & KPIs (for Prototype Evaluation)

User Engagement:
Measure average time spent on the platform and the number of interactions per contest.
System Performance:
Monitor average response times, uptime, and system load during peak contest periods.
Focus on building the core functionalities: event creation, automated registration/team formation, real-time tracking, integrated communication, and certificate distribution.
